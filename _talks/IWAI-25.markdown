I gave one of the keynote lectures at the [2025 edition of IWAI](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io/). No abstract was ever created, but if I had to make one, I would say this: 

_Abstract_:

We will review some old and new results detailiing the mathematical and physical foundations of the free energy principle, and some new results generalising those pictures to time-varying non-equilibrium systems will be given.
