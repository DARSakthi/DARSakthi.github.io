I was privileged to give one of the keynote lectures at the [2025 edition of IWAI](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io/). Thank you to Mahault Albarracin for the invitation and to all of the organisers, volunteers, and staff, for all of the effort which was put into organising an historic year for the conference. 

For this lecture, no abstract was ever created; if I had to make one, I would say the following.

_Abstract_:

We will review some older and more current results concerning the mathematical and physical foundations of the free energy principle. Some new results generalising those pictures to time-varying non-equilibrium systems will be given.
