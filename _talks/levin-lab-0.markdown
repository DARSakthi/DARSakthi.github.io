I gave a talk to the Levin lab about my recent work on gauge symmetries, inference, and self-organisation.

_Abstract_: 

We give an account of inference in the context of self-organisation, with particular focus on structures like Turing patterns or developing cell linesâ€”objects which seem too simple to be cognitive, but self-organise nonetheless. Under the free energy principle and the closely related principle of maximum entropy, we can show that these objects exhibit a sort of elemental inference, which closely resembles the kind of representation-based cognition that humans do. Connections to basal cognition and cognition in unconventional substrates are drawn. We also relate self-organisation to a gauge force arising from constraints on what states can be occupied by a system.

As a precursor to this talk, I gave an account of some technical aspects of this work to the Levin lab and collaborators. That talk was hosted by the [VERSES Research Lab]({{ site.url }}/verses-lab).
