I gave a keynote at this year's complex systems society meeting in the [Physics of Self-Organization in Complex Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/physics-of-self-org-ccs24/home) session. The abstract can be found at the previous link or [here (link to file)](https://darsakthi.github.io/files/CCS%202024%20abs.pdf). Many thanks go to [Georgi Georgiev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hne_SUIAAAAJ&hl=en) for the invitation.

The content was very similar to previous talks at [Stony Brook's Laufer Centre](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks/laufer-23) and the [University of Vienna](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks/wien-23) and followed the discussion in the paper [arXiv:2406.11630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630) very closely. There will be a proceedings volume with more details published shortly.
