_Abstract_: 

We will trace through the logic of (a particular form of) Friston's free energy principle and show how one arrives at the statement "interacting random processes with non-equilibrium steady state densities look as if they minimise variational free energy."  We will then explore how the FEP can be related to the physics of non-equilibrium systems by considering the connection between variational free energy minimisation and the maintenance of certain fluxes of energy in and out of a system.  This suggests some connections to Jaynes' principle of maximum calibre which we will comment on to conclude our discussion.
