I gave a talk to the Levin lab and collaborators about my recent work on gauge symmetries, inference, and self-organisation. This seminar was hosted by VERSES.

_Abstract_: 

We give an account of inference in the context of self-organisation, with particular focus on structures like Turing patterns or developing cell linesâ€”objects which seem too simple to be cognitive, but self-organise nonetheless. Under the free energy principle and maximum entropy methods for inference, we can show that these objects exhibit a sort of elemental inference, which closely resembles the kind of representation-based cognition that humans do. Connections to basal cognition and cognition in unconventional substrates are drawn. We also relate self-organisation to a gauge force arising from constraints on what states can be occupied by a system.
