This is a poster about a paper of mine, [A Worked Example of the Bayesian Mechanics of Classical Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12996). It will appear at [IWAI2022](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io), in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2022. Interested readers can also see me do a ~one minute [virtual pitch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17estYcRM8h5KqVo-FIJK0bUcILAgtoOT/view?usp=sharing) of the poster. I will appear on the Active Inference Lab's podcast to talk about this work; see there for more extended remarks. Links are available on the [/other](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/) tab of my website.
