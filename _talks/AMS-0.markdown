I will be giving a talk at this year's Fall [AMS Western Sectional Meeting](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2295_program.html) in the following [special session](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2295_program_ss7.html#title): PDEs, Data, and Inverse Problems. The meeting is hosted this year by the University of Utah. Many thanks to [Vincent R Martinez](http://math.hunter.cuny.edu/vmartine/) for inviting me to this session.

_Abstract:_ 

Physical systems and the partial differential equations used to model them often exhibit phases: dynamical regimes with distinct qualitative behaviour, such as attractors. Understanding how such regimes arise is important to understanding the onset of features of complexity in physics, and to making physical sense of the non-universal behaviours of many PDEs. We propose a Lyapunov function inspired by statistical inference that describes phase occupation and the dynamics of order parameters in probabilistic terms. This defines a large deviations principle that makes our framework valid outside of equilibrium, and extends it beyond the usual notion of a Landau phase.
