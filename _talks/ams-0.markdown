I will be giving a talk at the [AMS Western Sectional](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2295_program.html) in the following [special session](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2295_program_ss7.html#title): PDEs, Data, and Inverse Problems. The meeting is hosted this year by the University of Utah.

_Abstract:_ 

An adiabatic system is a particular sort of PDE with broad applications to physics. In this talk I propose that the use of hierarchical Bayesian inference, as it is employed elsewhere in statistical physics, clarifies the presence of global order parameters, and thus, topological phases, in adiabatic systems where the separation of timescales implied is relevant to parametric Bayesian inference. Known algorithms like dynamic causal modelling are discussed.
