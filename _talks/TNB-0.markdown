I gave the following seminar at UCL's [Theoretical Neurobiology](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/theoretical-neurobiology-team/) meeting.

_Abstract_: 

How can we construct solutions to arbitrary diffusion processes? This question poses a challenge, as diffusion processes can be characterised as (non-linear, chaotic) partial 
differential equations. As such, this is effectively a subset of a large, open problem in analysis and mathematical physics, which is a general treatment of the theory of PDEs. 
We will use strategies from the former in pursuit of this objective, namely, formalisms from higher geometry for defining arbitrary dynamics in a space. From this, we derive an 
adaptation of Jaynesâ€™ Maximum Calibre, offering a principled construction of a general solution to diffusion-based PDEs. We further examine how to apply these results in 
data-driven calculations.
