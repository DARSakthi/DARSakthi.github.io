The VERSES Research Lab is a centre for research in statistical and biological physics, complexity science, and artifical and human intelligence; robust work on theory, algorithms, techniques, and methods for optimisation and machine learning also happens in the lab. Via its research interests in the free energy principle and its corollaries—active inference, predictive processing, and Bayesian mechanics—the lab is producing highly original work in these areas. VERSES and the Spatial Web Foundation have generously funded this work. The research group consists of the following people:
