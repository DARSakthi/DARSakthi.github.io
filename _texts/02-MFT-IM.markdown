Here is a paper I wrote about the Ising model. It contains some statements and some formalisations of results that are often referenced but rarely cited. It introduces MFT in a 
nice way and is fairly self-contained; I hope it can serve as a reference for those learning about the Ising model or mean field techniques.

This has now been published in _SciPost Physics Lecture Notes_, a great diamond open access journal, with counterparts in both physics and mathematics. Magnetisation and Mean Field Theory in the Ising Model can be found at [_SciPost Physics Lecture Notes_, 35, 2021](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhysLectNotes.35).
