These are notes for the 2021-2022 algebraic topology reading group on $$\infty$$-category theory. These notes provide a brief overview of important material in chapter one of our reference text, Land's \emph{Introduction to $$\infty$$-Category Theory}. Section 3 includes some further remarks. The notation and concepts are (mostly) consistent with Land. This is not a comprehensive discussion of these topics, and so I also recommend Emily Riehl's stellar set of notes [A Leisurely Introduction to Simplicial Sets](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/ssets.pdf), and the material found in [Kerodon](https://kerodon.net). I can further recommend Friedman's survey on simplicial sets \[ [arXiv:0809.4221](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4221) \] and Groth's survey on $$\infty$$-categories \[ [arXiv:1007.2925](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2925) \]. Chapter 6 (6.1.2 in particular) of Lurie's [_Higher Topos Theory_](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf) contains more information on classifying spaces.
