title: Regularity Structures Reading Group
---

Autumn 2022 reading group on Martin Hairer's regularity structures \[[main text: arXiv:1303.5113](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5113)\], with an eye towards stochastic quantisation \[see, e.g., [arXiv:2201.03487](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03487)\]. Find notes and useful links on this page. For urgent communications, please contact me [by email](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu).

# Administrative

Join the Discord server for this group with [this invitation](...). 

Zoom coordinates: [meeting link](...), XXXX on -day-.

We will begin with some preliminaries, namely, [2, Introduction to Regularity Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3014) and [3, Motion of a Random String](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02192). The plan is to move on to the main text [1, A Theory of Regularity Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5113) by our fourth meeting on (date4). With a few weeks left we will attempt to transition to [4, Stochastic Quantisation of Yang-Mills-Higgs in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03487).
