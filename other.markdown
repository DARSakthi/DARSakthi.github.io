# Outreach and Advocacy

I am signatory
- 1249 (post publication) to le collectif 'no fake science'
- 1226 to the USACBI boycott
- 379 to the No Free View? No Review! pledge
- 151 to the Just Mathematics Collective 'Mathematics Beyond Secrecy and Surveillance' initiative

I feel strongly about [free and open](https://julesh.com/2021/02/16/free-publishing/) science. Profiteering and exploitation in academic publishing needs to end, and the products of publicly-funded research ought to be made accessible to the public. Besides simply being fair, this can help promote wider scientific literacy, another problem which I feel must be attended to.

I am originally (though not completely) Indian. Because of this, I also feel strongly about [equity in science and mathematics](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/). I am a member of Spectra's [AllyList](http://lgbtmath.org/People.html), which means I have committed to making mathematical spaces everywhere more inclusive towards LGBTQ+ individuals.

I have been involved in [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) in various capacities since the first conference in May of 2020, mostly as an organisational or [instructional volunteer](https://darsakthi.github.io/teaching/2020-NMA). In the 2021 Computational Neuroscience School I was a faculty mentor.

I am also a member of the VERSES Research Ethics Board. I believe it is important to think through the ethical implications of my and othersâ€™ research. In particular, mathematics has been misused and abused in the past. It is paramount that we bear in mind who and what we do mathematics in service of.

# Media and Press

On 13 June 2022 I appeared on one of the [Active Inference Lab](https://www.activeinference.org/home)'s podcasts, ActInfLab GuestStream, episode 23.1, which was [livestreamed here](https://youtu.be/igY9iyowesc). I will appear on the podcast again in October to discuss my classical physics paper (LiveStream [episode 49.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtC-Enmc8M) and [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuBJBEg9LI)).
