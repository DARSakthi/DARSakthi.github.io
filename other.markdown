# Outreach and Advocacy

I am signatory
- 1249 (post publication) to le collectif 'no fake science'
- 1226 to the USACBI boycott
- 379 to the No Free View? No Review! pledge
- 151 to the Just Mathematics Collective 'Mathematics Beyond Secrecy and Surveillance' initiative

I feel strongly about [free and open](https://julesh.com/2021/02/16/free-publishing/) science. I also feel strongly about [equity in science and mathematics](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/).

I have been involved in [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) in various capacities since the first conference in May of 2020, mostly as an organisational or [instructional volunteer](https://darsakthi.github.io/teaching/2020-NMA). 

I am also a member of the VERSES Research Ethics Board. I believe strongly in thinking through the ethical implications of my and othersâ€™ research.
