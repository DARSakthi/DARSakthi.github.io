# Outreach and Advocacy

I am signatory
- 1249 (post publication) to le collectif 'no fake science'
- 1226 to the USACBI boycott
- 375 to the No Free View? No Review! pledge
- 29 to the Just Mathematics Collective 'Mathematics Beyond Secrecy and Surveillance' initiative

I feel strongly about open access [1] and free and open [2] science. Profiteering and exploitation in academic publishing needs to end, and the products of publicly-funded research ought to be made accessible to the public. Besides simply being fair, both can help promote wider scientific literacy, another problem which I feel must be attended to.

I also feel strongly about equity [3] in science [4] and mathematics [5] (I am originally, though not completely, Indian). I am a member of Spectra's [AllyList](http://lgbtmath.org/People.html), which means I have committed to making mathematical spaces everywhere more inclusive towards LGBTQ+ individuals. Some articles on these subjects which have resonated me include those cited above, as well as [6-9].

I have been involved in [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) in various capacities since the first conference in May of 2020, mostly as an organisational or [instructional volunteer](https://darsakthi.github.io/teaching/2020-NMA). In the 2021 Computational Neuroscience School I was a faculty mentor.

I am a member of the VERSES Research Ethics Board. I believe it is important to think through the ethical implications of my and others’ research. Mathematics has been misused and abused in the past; we should always bear in mind who and what we do mathematics in service of. I am particularly opposed to military applications of my work [10-13], a problem which is beginning to affect areas adjacent to my research.

# Media and Press

On 13 June 2022 I appeared on one of the [Active Inference Lab](https://www.activeinference.org/home)'s podcasts, ActInfLab GuestStream, episode 23.1, which was [livestreamed here](https://youtu.be/igY9iyowesc). There I discussed my paper [On Bayesian Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11543).

On 5 October 2022 I appeared on one of the Active Inference Lab's podcasts, LiveStream [episode 49.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtC-Enmc8M). I discussed my paper on [classical physics for the Bayesian mechanic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12996). This work was reviewed prior to my appearence in the previous episode, [49.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtX2Fpzn7KA).

On 12 October 2022 I appeared again for LiveStream [episode 49.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuBJBEg9LI), also discussing my classical physics paper.
