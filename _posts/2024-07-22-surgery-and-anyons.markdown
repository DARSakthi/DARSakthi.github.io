Here I will provide some geometric intuition for the discussions in a recent preprint with [Y L Liu](https://leon2k2k2k.github.io/). (The title of this blog post is the unused title of an older draft and was proposed by Leon.)

In that preprint we share some results relating classifications of abelian topological orders to surgery classifications of (spin) three-manifolds, turning geometric reasoning about a given manifold into algebraic manipulation of the associated Chern-Simons theory and _vice versa_.

I'm a strong believer in geometric intuition being powerful and important.
