At first blush, the VERSES Lab is merely a consortium of statistical physics and physics-adjacent[^1] researchers with interests in a variety of applications of the so-called _free energy principle_, including stochastic processes, physics-inspired machine learning and machine learning theory, and human neuroscience. On [this page](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/), I call it "an international centre for research in statistical physics, biological physics, and complexity science, as well as artifical and human intelligence" where "robust work on algorithms, techniques, and foundations for optimisation and learning theory in statistics also happens." The lab began in mid-January of 2022 but didn't really take off until early February 2022. Since I will be on holiday until mid-January, and believe in reflecting _before_ the year's end, I wanted to get this post out now. What is this post I hear you ask? Here is a state of the union style report on everything myself and my collaborators have achieved so far this year, and maybe some words on what comes next. 

Firstly, why is it important to me that I write this post? I admit it is partially self-indulgence; we have achieved a lot and I'd like to congratulate the whole lab. However, the other...

[^1]: I think this is a little reductive; in the lab there's something like a division into physics, philosophy, machine learning (theory and implementation), and pure mathematics that defies categorisation as physics and physics-adjacent. But, I think the sentence is morally true.
