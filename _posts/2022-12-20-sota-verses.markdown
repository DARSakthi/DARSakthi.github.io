On [this page](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/), I call it "an international centre for research in statistical physics, biological physics, and complexity science, as well as artifical and human intelligence" where "robust work on algorithms, techniques, and foundations for optimisation and learning theory in statistics also happens." The lab began in mid-January of 2022 but didn't really take off until early February 2022. Since I will be on holiday until mid-January, and believe in reflecting _before_ the year's end, I wanted to get this post out now. What is this post I hear you ask?
