I'm now contributing to, and co-editing, a [special issue of the journal _Symmetry_](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry/special_issues/Making_Breaking_Symmetries_Mind_Life). The abstract I've promised (and on which I hope to deliver) is located at that link. This paper is something I've been thinking about for a while. It seems like it should be possible to connect the language of FEP with some of the objects that we understand well in mathematical physics, given the way FEP extends older variational and dynamical ideas in statistical physics. A re-axiomatisation of the free energy principle is exactly what I, a complex systems theorist after excessive mathematical rigour, find interesting, and may be useful to the larger community.

Indeed, the unification of mathematical physics with biophysics and computer science aligns with my general philosophy quite strongly, as I think it's the best way to understand such systems. It is for this reason that I really believe this is an interesting set of questions, framed masterfully by my co-editors. In particular, it was the lead editor, Adam Safron, who generated the list of questions and potential insights listed in the issue. It also seems that _Symmetry_ is the best venue in which to discuss such a wide-reaching issue. 

If you are someone who works at some intersection between computer science, biology, or physics, defined by symmetry or invariance, do contribute. My favourite phrase is 'fee waiver,' so as a policy internal to the editors (at least one editor, and indeed, they're all wonderful people) every effort will be made to ensure it is worth it.
