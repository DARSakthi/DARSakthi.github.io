Here I'll briefly summarise some of the coarser points of a recent preprint of mine, [...](...), and in doing so, summarise the state of the art of Bayesian mechanics. The introduction of the paper frames this summary quite well. I'll get to talk about supersymmetry too, which will be fun.

Everybody likes [examples](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/326912/story-of-grothendiecks-prime-number-57). It's well and good to speak in abstracts, but a good example seems to make things 'click' better than any statement or restatement of a general principle. One thing the free energy principle and Bayesian mechanics appears to lack is examples. It's important to note that that isn't quite true, but nevertheless, the impression one gets when looking at the literature is that it's a mathematical theory, spoken of in full generality, and occasionally makes its way down to earth to meet physics or biology. [A page summarising my research interests](https://darsakthi.github.io/research/) now has, at the bottom, a Bayesian mechanical bibliography; here I've recorded some key moments in the story so far. Only two of those key moments are about examples. I'm partially guilty of making that worse, and I recognise that it's not a terribly reader-friendly state of affairs. This was the beginning of my motivation for writing the paper I will discuss here. 

More specifically, in developing the narrative for [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11543) (we'll call it [RSH+22]) it became apparent to me that there was a very nice way of tying Bayesian mechanics into the classical stationary action principle, which Karl has emphasised is one 'right' way of thinking about the free energy principle from the beginning; it was also pointed out to me by [Brennan Klein](https://www.jkbrennan.com) that, just like we have a few different use cases of Newton's laws of motion under least action, it looks like we might have different use cases of Bayesian inference under what I have presumptuously called 'least surprisal.' Between that, and my [ongoing desire](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07793) to write Bayesian mechanics as a consequence of the principle of maximum calibre (what Maxwell Ramstead has referred to as $$G$$-theory), there was enough there to actually write something.

The paper walks through the same typology as what exists in the abstract in [RSH+22], with the concrete boundary condition that the mode we try to match is a classical equation of motion. Ultimately, the paper just demonstrates that minimising surprisal parameterised by classical equations of motion gets you classical equations of motion, which is precisely the tautology characterising attractor states in Bayesian mechanics—the idea is really as simple as, 'systems that go to attractors are unsurprising when they go to attractors.' If $$P(s)$$ is 'system occupies an attractor' and $$Q(s)$$ is 'system minimises surprisal on that attractor,' then the converse ($$Q(s)\implies P(s)$$) and inverse ($$\neg P(s)\implies\neg Q(s)$$) statements are more interesting, and these are what ugrade BMech to a modelling tool which says something useful about a system; these are 'systems minimise surprise to get to an attractor' and 'the surprisal of systems that do not go to attractors increases beyond what is acceptable to a system in such an attractor,' respectively.

Here we have a few such examples of what that attractor is, one being a set of states around a fixed mode, another being a fixed set of states around a moving mode, and the third being attractors in path spaces. There's far more to say about the topology of this latter situation, as well as chaotic attractors in Bayesian mechanics, that we don't get to cover. We do get to sketch out what it looks like to do a gradient descent on a path space, and this functional gradient becomes equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equation as a gradient in a path space, which is a neat result. We also discover that the degree of exploration within one such attractor—for instance, the exponential divergence of trajectories in ergodic systems which explore every state in an attractor—has something to do with _supersymmetry_. 

Here I'll carry on about supersymmetry a bit, but the key deliverables have been summarised in such a way that the reader can ignore it if necessary.
