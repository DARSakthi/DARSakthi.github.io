It's not a secret that I support open access publishing. If I've met you before you've probably heard my opinions on this matter (if not, [avail yourself here](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/)). A couple of weeks ago, the arXiv—mainstay of academic research in mathematics, physics, computer science, and more—ran a formum on accessibility in scientific writing. A key question: "if it's not accessible, is it really open science?" Of course, a similar question could be asked from the perspective of the author instead of the reader. Publishing and disseminating results and findings has been the foundation of mathematics and the sciences since antiquity. If academic publishing is not accessible to trainees and groups with smaller amounts of funding, is it really science at all? 

A year ago I nearly guest-edited a special issue with the MDPI journal _Symmetry_. I assembled some facts and figures to share with them regarding their egregious article processing charges and now want to share them with you. Below I have included the email I sent the chief editor of _Symmetry_, more or less copied and pasted. For legal reasons, I probably ought to point out that these are factual statements of publicly available information and do not constitute a tort. Since [MDPI is not the type to take bad press well](https://www.chronicle.com/article/publisher-threatens-to-sue-blogger-for-1-billion/), it really seems prudent to note that I am simply stating the facts of the matter, free of embellishment or interpretation. 

My personal issues with MPDI go beyond the numbers outlined below. Much has been written about this and I am not the first or only person to feel this way, so what shall I be doing about it? For one thing, I will not be submitting to MDPI journals, nor will I be editing and reviewing for them. I would encourage others to do the same. MDPI has some journals (namely, _Entropy_) which address an unmet niche in terms of longer-form or more interdisplinary publishing venues, and taking advantage of a fast publication is a symptom of a deeper problem, not a real problem. We certainly shouldn't judge our colleagues or their papers in MDPI journals unfairly. Nonetheless—it is important to show that we will not be extorted. The truth is MDPI has taken us in; they've identified these unmet needs and treated them as business opportunities. What we should do is fill that vacuum ourselves. For instance, [a blog post by Timothy Gowers](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/elsevier-my-part-in-its-downfall/) (and a few more related posts listed under that one), which are all very similar to this one, preciptated his beginning a new journal from scratch which met that need for a different sort of venue in discrete maths. Direct action is always in style. 

In any case, you will not be surprised to hear that the response from the chief editor was more handwaving about the costs associated with publication, suggesting my email had fallen on completely ignorant ears. More's the better—at least I was motivated to no longer waste any time with MDPI. The co-editors of the aforementioned special issue had their own part to play in supporting us moving from MDPI to a different journal (you know who you are, and I thank you). 

If you read this and you have a paper under review at MDPI, consider pulling it, or consider (armed with the following facts) asking for a fee waiver. Some of this data is bound to be out of date, given it's a year old, but a brief look at their 2021 and 2022 annual reports reveal similar figures. 

Enough meta-commentary: on with the show.

&nbsp;

I. Four key details of the situation are as follows—
         
- In 2020, MDPI published 167000 articles—most all of them from special issues like this one—and made between 190 and 230 million [1] in revenue from the APCs of these papers.
         
- This APC has grown exponentially in the past few years, from 100s of dollars to 1000s of dollars.
         
- This happens whilst other 'diamond' open access journals publish without cost to the author.
         
- Proponents of MDPI claim it is more inclusive [2], relaxing things like word limits and editorial criteria.
         
II. Now, your 2020 annual report [3] states that 
         
- MDPI waived fees for approximately 30% of all content in 2020. This is consistent with the figure reported in the 2019 report (25-27%). This is 50100 articles, going by the above figure.
         
- "For journals in fields with low levels of funding, where authors typically do not have funds available, _APCs are typically waived_" [emphasis mine]. Again, the same language is found in your 2019 report [4].
         
In effect, it seems quite simple to me—offering larger waivers more consistently is both necessary for the success of this issue, and allowable by MDPI's own admission. The first salient point is: given such an excess in cash flow, when overheads of other journals would suggest this is unnecessary, I see no reason why your profit margin would rest on the full APCs of a dozen or so papers. Further, since enough waivers are set aside to cover at least partial losses on 50100 articles, I have every confidence that you will be able to find the money if you look for it. If you're in need of motivation, then let me reiterate—to lose any invited author's paper would be highly disappointing, as it concerns the success of the issue. 
           
Moreover, recall that the study of symmetry takes place primarily in the field of pure mathematics and mathematical physics. These are amongst the worst funded fields in the natural sciences. The average individual NSERC grant in mathematical physics is in the 35000 to 45000 dollar range, usually over a number of years. Just recently, the average size of an NSF three year grant was 30000 USD [5]. Total NSF expenditure [6] on mathematics is a fraction (0.5-5%) [7] of that of other fields, and has been on the decline overall since the 1960s [8]. The average per annum funding level for mathematicians in the US (external, non-institutional funds, e.g. NSF or DOD awards) is miniscule, often not even covering summer salaries. In accordance with point II.2, I would expect all fees to be partially or fully waived automatically. Why is this not the case, if your annual reports are accurate? At this point, I would remind you that as a registered joint-stock corporation in Basel [9], you are required to maintain reliable, consolidated reports under the Swiss code of obligations, including anything that could be construed as management information, or expected losses, especially in terms of voluntary retained earnings or deferred income (refer to [10], page 16; the articles cited therein, especially CO 958c, CO 959a(2), and CO 961c; as well as to [11], page 6.).
          
It is simply unimaginable to ask someone to pay this quantity of money out of their own pockets. I presume this is exactly why the language found in the annual reports exists, and yet, it is not being implemented, despite both legal and practical (if not moral) obligations to the contrary. As to point I.4, and following the argument above—in reality, the costs associated with publishing at MDPI make it far more exclusive than other journals. This is the very thing I would have us avoid in this case. We are excluding talented young scientists because they are unable to pay to play, and there are few things I stomach less easily than exclusion. Never mind that this issue will fail utterly if we can't make further accommodations. 
           
On a personal note, as I said, I am a mathematician, where low cost open access has been a standard since the 90s. There is no universe in which I (or any other non-industry mathematician) would pay 1800 CHF, or even 75%, of that to publish a paper. Moreover, I am hesitant to put my name on something that has been condemned to failure before it's even properly begun; and, I generally refuse to be party to exclusion. I would certainly find it regrettable to pass on the chance to work with some amazing co-editors, but this is simply the reality. It's somewhat based in principle, but it's obvious that the core of this argument is purely utilitarian.
            
The bottom line is, if any author invited to contribute to this special issue requests a partial or full fee waiver on the grounds of financial hardship, I would expect it to be granted. It ought to be granted as requested and without question, pursuant to your own (necessarily accurate) annual reporting. This issue is simply dead on arrival if we don't do this, and I see no legitimate reason not to proceed in this fashion. So, this is your invitation to reconsider, especially in accordance with points II.1 and II.2.
