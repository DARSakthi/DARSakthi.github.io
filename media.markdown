Other activities of or relating to my work


# Outreach

I have been involved in [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io) in various capacities since the first conference in May of 2020, mostly as an organisational or [instructional volunteer](https://darsakthi.github.io/teaching/2020-NMA). 

# Media and Press

On 13 June 2022 I appeared on one of the [Active Inference Lab](https://www.activeinference.org/home)'s podcasts, ActInfLab GuestStream, episode 23.1, which was [livestreamed here](https://youtu.be/igY9iyowesc).
