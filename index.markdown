I am currently a member of faculty at the [CUNY Graduate Centre](https://www.gc.cuny.edu), where I am visiting under the Einstein Chair professorship in [mathematics](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/mathematics). Previously, I have been at Stony Brook University and MIT. From January 2022 to November 2025 I was also the lead researcher in the theory group at the [VERSES Research Lab](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/). 

For a summary of my current research, see [this page (/research)](https://darsakthi.github.io/research). I am broadly interested in topology and how it threads through different areas of algebra, analysis, and arithmetic. I am often motivated by objects or questions in mathematical and statistical physics. Chern--Simons theories feature heavily in my work as rich objects living in the intersection of these areas. I am also interested in probability theory and its applications: I have a secondary research programme devoted to (non-equilibrium) statistical field theory and the properties of spaces of functions.

My articles (with bibliographic information) can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-7907-7611.html) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mWJtfUUAAAAJ). Some of the talks I have given are viewable [here (/talks)](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks). Advocacy and press relating to my work can be found [here (/other)](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/). I maintain a [blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog) about my work, amongst other things. I can also be found on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/370636/dalton-a-r-sakthivadivel) and with ORCiD [0000-0002-7907-7611](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7907-7611).
