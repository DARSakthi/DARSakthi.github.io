# About and Contact Information

I am a researcher primarily affiliated with the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University, along with the Research and Development Group at VERSES Labs and the Spatial Web Foundation. I am also involved in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the Renaissance School of Medicine. Previously, I have been at MIT, as well as the London-based AI and active inference think tank, Nested Minds Solutions. Since January 2022 much of my work has been funded by VERSES and the Spatial Web Foundation.

I take a particular interest in complex systems theory, and understanding features of complexity in both biology and physics. My research often focusses on the mathematical structure of complex systems. I’m active in mathematical and statistical physics; especially geometric and category theoretic methods, non-equilibrium statistical physics, and dynamical systems theory. One of my long-term research goals is to formulate an axiomatic complex systems theory. I often apply this philosophy to questions in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning—at times I have taken an interest in clinical objectives in the computational modelling of the brain, as well as foundations and theory in machine learning.

What this means is, I study—and try to find—mathematical laws that explain the more complicated things in our world, using a variety of methods that map mathematical descriptions onto physical objects. I study these things generally, but, I am especially interested in how the brain (and other random systems) work from the standpoint of mathematics and physics. To understand this, I often work in an area broadly called 'complex systems theory.' The study of complex systems isn’t precisely mathematics yet, because it lacks axioms and theorems at the standard of mathematical proof. This is one of the things my research focusses on. 

My articles can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-7907-7611.html), and occasionally on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/search/author1%3ADalton%2BA%2BR%2BSakthivadivel%2B). I tend to give a lot of talks, so I encourage the reader to look at these as well—some of them are viewable [here](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks). Otherwise, reach me at [dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu).

It seems like something of a tradition for mathematicians to maintain a [blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog) about their work, amongst other things. I think it would be nice to post about specific items (e.g. papers) every once in a while, which will happen on this website. I also make posts on twitter, [@DaltonSakthi](https://twitter.com/DaltonSakthi), where I am sometimes more active. In addition, I can be found on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/370636/dalton-a-r-sakthivadivel), on [Wikipaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dalton.sakthi), and with [ORCiD 0000-0002-7907-7611](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7907-7611). If one looks hard enough, I've been known to show up in various places on Discord.
