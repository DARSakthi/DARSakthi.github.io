# About and Contact Information

I am currently senior researcher in the mathematics group at the [VERSES Research Lab](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/). I am on leave from the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University, where I was also involved in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering inside SBU's Renaissance School of Medicine. Previously, I was at MIT. Since January 2022 much of my work has been funded by VERSES.

I am broadly interested in applying methods from mathematical physics, like geometry, topology, and category theory, to problems in statistical and biological physics, stochastic dynamics, and probability theory. One of my long-term research goals is to formulate an axiomatic complex systems theory. For a summary of my current research, see [this page (/research)](https://darsakthi.github.io/research).

My articles can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-7907-7611.html). Some of the talks I have given are viewable [here (/talks)](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks). Advocacy and press relating to my work can be found [here (/other)](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/). Otherwise, reach me at [dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu) or [dalton.sakthivadivel@verses.io](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@verses.io).

It seems like something of a tradition for mathematicians to maintain a [blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog) about their work, amongst other things. I think it would be nice to post about specific items (e.g. papers) every once in a while, which will happen on this website. I also make posts on twitter, [@DaltonSakthi](https://twitter.com/DaltonSakthi), where I am sometimes more active. In addition, I can be found on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/370636/dalton-a-r-sakthivadivel), infrequently on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dalton.sakthi), and with ORCiD [0000-0002-7907-7611](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7907-7611). Other useful links: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mWJtfUUAAAAJ), [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/D.-A.-R.-Sakthivadivel/2047545652), [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/search/author1%3ADalton%2BA%2BR%2BSakthivadivel%2B). If one looks hard enough, I've been known to show up in various places on Discord.
