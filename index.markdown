I am currently a visitor at the [mathematics department](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/mathematics) of the [CUNY Graduate Centre](https://www.gc.cuny.edu) under the Einstein Chair professorship in mathematics. senior researcher in the mathematics group at the [VERSES Research Lab](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/). I am on leave from Stony Brook University. Previously, I was at MIT. Since January 2022 much of my work has been funded by VERSES.

For a summary of my current research, see [this page (/research)](https://darsakthi.github.io/research). I am broadly interested in topology and how it threads through different areas of algebra and analysis. I am often motivated by objects or questions in mathematical and statistical physics. I am particularly interested in probability theory and its applications.

My articles (with bibliographic information) can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-7907-7611.html). Some of the talks I have given are viewable [here (/talks)](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks). Advocacy and press relating to my work can be found [here (/other)](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/). I maintain a [blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog) about my work, amongst other things. I can also be found on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/370636/dalton-a-r-sakthivadivel) and with ORCiD [0000-0002-7907-7611](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7907-7611).
