# About and Contact Information

I am a researcher primarily affiliated with the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University, the [VERSES Research Lab](https://darsakthi.github.io/verses-lab/), and the Spatial Web Foundation more broadly. I am also involved in the Department of Biomedical Engineering inside SBU's Renaissance School of Medicine, and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at SBU. Previously, I was at MIT, and I have also consulted for the London-based AI and active inference think tank, Nested Minds Solutions. Since January 2022 much of my work has been funded by VERSES and the Spatial Web Foundation.

I am broadly interested in applying methods from mathematical physics, like geometry, topology, and category theory, to problems in statistical and biological physics, stochastic dynamics, and probability theory. One of my long-term research goals is to formulate an axiomatic complex systems theory. Myself and some collaborators have recently used the free energy principle to develop a promising new approach to the statistical physics of non-equilibria and complexity, called _Bayesian mechanics_. For a summary of my current research, see [this page](https://darsakthi.github.io/research).

My articles can be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-7907-7611.html), and occasionally on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/search/author1%3ADalton%2BA%2BR%2BSakthivadivel%2B). I tend to give a lot of talks, so I encourage the reader to look at these as well—some of them are viewable [here](https://darsakthi.github.io/talks). Advocacy and press relating to my work can be found [here](https://darsakthi.github.io/other/). Otherwise, reach me at [dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@stonybrook.edu) or [dalton.sakthivadivel@verses.io](mailto:dalton.sakthivadivel@verses.io).

It seems like something of a tradition for mathematicians to maintain a [blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog) about their work, amongst other things. I think it would be nice to post about specific items (e.g. papers) every once in a while, which will happen on this website. I also make posts on twitter, [@DaltonSakthi](https://twitter.com/DaltonSakthi), where I am sometimes more active. In addition, I can be found on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/370636/dalton-a-r-sakthivadivel), on [Wikipaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dalton.sakthi), and with ORCiD [0000-0002-7907-7611](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7907-7611). If one looks hard enough, I've been known to show up in various places on Discord.
