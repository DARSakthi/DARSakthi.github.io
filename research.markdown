I am broadly interested in applying methods from mathematical physics, like geometry, topology, and category theory, to problems in statistical and biological physics, stochastic dynamics, and probability theory. I take a particular interest in 

- complex and cybernetic systems, and    

- understanding features of complexity in both biology and physics.

At times I have taken an interest in theoretical neuroscience, like the multiscale modelling of the human brain (i.e., cortical organisation and firing dynamics in health and disease). I have also been interested in theory and foundations for machine learning, and formal approaches to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Regardless of the specific system, one of my long-term research goals is to formulate an axiomatic complex systems theory, determining where features of complexity come from in some rule-based fashion. My research thus often has an eye towards formal structures for systems which are analytically difficult; conversely, I often use the physics of such systems as an inspiration for developing new mathematical tools.

In the widest possible terms, what this means is, I study—and try to find—**mathematical laws that explain how the more complicated things in our world work**, and why they work that way, using a variety of methods that map mathematical descriptions onto physical objects. I study these things generally, but, I am especially interested in how systems like the brain (and other random systems) work from the standpoint of rigorous mathematics and physics. To understand this, I often work in an area broadly called 'complex systems theory.' The study of complex systems isn’t precisely mathematics yet, because it lacks laws—axioms and theorems—at the standard of [mathematical proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof). My research usually focusses on the mathematical structure of these complex systems, and attempts to determine what those laws might be.

## Bayesian Mechanics

For the last few years I have worked primarily on ideas related to the [free energy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), which I believe to be a good scaffold for a mathematical theory of complexity. Myself and some collaborators are working on developing a promising new approach to the statistical physics of non-equilibria and complexity, called _Bayesian mechanics._

What is Bayesian mechanics? Our best attempt at an axiomatic characterisation of complexity unifies the study of stochastic thermodynamics, interacting random processes, and the topological and geometric features of dynamical systems. This lays out a theory of how one could formulate a picture of interacting random dynamical systems in a way that is conducive to axiomatisation, and which captures all the relevant teleological notions of complexity. Bayesian mechanics differs from conventional approaches to modelling complex systems in the sense that it is dual to those approaches: instead of modelling the system, we model the system modelling its environment, and connect the system's belief states to its physical states. Somehow this is like inhabiting the system and peering out, rather than existing outside and peering in. It turns out that this is an equivalent way of talking about how systems monitor themselves and where certain dynamics come from.

The recent paper [_A Worked Example of the Bayesian Mechanics of Classical Objects_](...) provides a good semi-formal, fast overview of recent progress in Bayesian mechanics, laying out the key ingredients and its connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. For a more comprehensive review of the state of the art, see [_On Bayesian Mechanics: A Physics of and by Beliefs_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11543). 

Explicit details and definitions about mode-matching in Bayesian mechanics, and some elaboration on the above duality, can be found in [_Towards a Geometry and Analysis for Bayesian Mechanics_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11900), whilst what I have called path-tracking appears in [_The Free Energy Principle Made Simpler but Not Too Simple_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06387). 

Its connection to control in a worked example of a stochastic process is written about in [_Bayesian Mechanics for Stationary Processes_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13830), and its proper definition as laws of motion for statistical manifolds is discussed in [_Markov Blankets, Information Geometry and Stochastic Thermodynamics_](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0159). 

The fullest single account of (a somewhat more nascent version of) the theory is the 2019 monograph [_A Free Energy Principle for a Particular Physics_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10184), and its initial formulation in terms of coupled random dynamical systems arguably dates back to [_A Free Energy Principle for Biological Systems_](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/14/11/2100). 

Other remarks about Bayesian mechanics can be found on [my blog](https://darsakthi.github.io/blog.html).
